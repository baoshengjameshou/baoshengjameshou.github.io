I'm a PhD student in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), part of the [GEMINI](https://gemini-erc.eu/){:target="_blank"} project team at Lancaster University, advised by [Prof. Hans Gellersen](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/hans-gellersen){:target="_blank"}. In GEMINI, we investigate the coordination of eye, head and body to design multimodal interfaces that better reflect the interplay of gaze and movement, and that let users interact more naturally in extended reality (XR), using their eyes and body in concert. 

In my research, I apply machine learning (ML) and signal processing to model human behaviour as context for interaction, with a focus on developing novel eye-head-based interaction techniques. I chase a future where ML-enabled computing power enhances human abilities, interfacing with us in naturally human ways. 

Using an experimental approach, I explore various interfacing technologies, including eye tracking, virtual reality and XR headsets, EOG, and EEG. With publications in _CHI_, _INTERACT_, _ETRA_, and _COGAIN_.

# Biography
Baosheng, also known as James, has an interdisiplinary backgronud and a passion to apply computing technologies to improve and augment people's lives (
<img src="images/pdfLogo.png" alt="pdf logo" width="10" height="20" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;">CV). He obtained his Bachelor's from the University of Auckland, adviced by [Assoc. Prof. Richard Clarke](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/rj-clarke){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. John Cater](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/contact-us/people/john-cater.html){:target="_blank"}, he modelled the computational fluid dynamics of the human vocal tract. James interned at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, where adviced by [Dr. Duane Malcom](https://www.flowx.io/about/){:target="_blank"}, he used machine learning to predict soft tissue deformation for cancer imaging. And advised by [Dr. Kumar Mithraratne](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/p-mithraratne/about){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Ted Yeung](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/ted-yeung){:target="_blank"}, modelled the motions of the human shoulder complex to evaluate novel motion tracking technologies. 

James obtained his Master's from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where he researched hybrid Brain-Computer Interfaces, adviced by [Assoc. Prof. Sadasivan Puthusserypady](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/sadasivan-puthusserypady){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. John Paulin Hansen](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/john-paulin-hansen){:target="_blank"}, their paper was given the Best Paper Award at the _2020 [COGAIN](http://cogain2020.cogain.org/){:target="_blank"} Symposium_. He was also part of a [gold-winning student team](https://2016.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark){:target="_blank"} at the 2016 international Genetically Engineered Machine ([iGEM](https://igem.org/){:target="_blank"}) competition, as a bioinformatics programmer and modeller, advised by [Assoc. Prof. Christopher Workman](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/christopher-workman){:target="_blank"}. 

After his MSc., James worked as a reseach assistant at DTU, led by [Dr. Fiona Mulvey](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/fiona-b-mulvey){:target="_blank"} and [Assoc. Prof. Per BÃ¦kgaard](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/per-b%C3%A6kgaard){:target="_blank"}, he collaborated with occupational therapists to develop smart visual aids as XR headset for visually-imparied patients. James then continued to [Prof. Hans Gellersen](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/hans-gellersen){:target="_blank"}'s lab at Lancaster University as a PhD student, where he applies ML and signal processing to develop novel classifiers for eye-head movements.
