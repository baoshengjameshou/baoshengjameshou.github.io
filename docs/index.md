I'm a PhD student in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), part of the [GEMINI](https://gemini-erc.eu/){:target="_blank"} project team at Lancaster University, supervised by [Prof. Hans Gellersen](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/hans-gellersen){:target="_blank"}. In GEMINI, we investigate the coordination of eye, head and body to design multimodal interfaces that 
more accurately capture the dynamic relationship between gaze and movement. Our goal is to enable users to 
<!-- better reflect the interplay of gaze and movement, and that let users  -->
interact more naturally in extended reality (XR), using their eyes and body in concert.

In my research, I apply machine learning (ML) and signal processing to model human behaviour as context for interaction, with a focus on developing novel eye-head-based interaction techniques. I aspire to a future in which ML-enabled devices enhance human capacities, interfacing in intuitively human ways.

# Biography
Baosheng, also known as James, has a background in biomedical engineering ([<img src="images/pdfLogo.png" alt="pdf logo" class="responsive-image">](docs/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"} [CV](docs/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}). He received his Bachelor's from the University of Auckland, supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Richard Clarke](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/rj-clarke){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. John Cater](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/contact-us/people/john-cater.html){:target="_blank"}, and modelled the computational fluid dynamics of the human vocal tract. James interned at the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, where he used machine learning to predict soft tissue deformation for cancer imaging, supervised by [Dr. Duane Malcom](https://www.flowx.io/about/){:target="_blank"}. And modelled the motions of the human shoulder complex to evaluate novel motion capture technologies, supervised by [Dr. Kumar Mithraratne](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/p-mithraratne/about){:target="_blank" } and [Dr. Ted Yeung](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/ted-yeung){:target="_blank"}.

James received his Master's from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), where he researched hybrid brain-computer interfaces, supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Sadasivan Puthusserypady](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/sadasivan-puthusserypady){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. John Paulin Hansen](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/john-paulin-hansen){:target="_blank"}, their [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3379157.3388932){:target="_blank"} was given the Best Paper Award at the _2020 [COGAIN](http://cogain.org/){:target="_blank"} Symposium_. James also served as a bioinformatics programmer and modeller on a [student team](https://2016.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark){:target="_blank"} that won a gold medal at an international synthetic biology competition ([iGEM](https://igem.org/){:target="_blank"}), advised by [Assoc. Prof. Christopher Workman](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/christopher-workman){:target="_blank"}. 

After his MSc., James worked as a research assistant at DTU, led by [Dr. Fiona Mulvey](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/fiona-b-mulvey){:target="_blank"}, [Assoc. Prof. Per BÃ¦kgaard](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/per-b%C3%A6kgaard){:target="_blank"}, and in collaboration with occupational therapists, he helped develop a smart visual aid as XR headset for visually imparied patients. James later joined the lab of [Prof. Hans Gellersen](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/hans-gellersen){:target="_blank"} at Lancaster University as a PhD student, where he now applies ML and signal processing to develop novel classifiers for eye-head movements. 

Using an experimental approach, James explores various interfacing technologies, including eye tracking, virtual reality and XR headsets, EOG glasses, and EEG. And has co-authored publications in _CHI_, _INTERACT_, _ETRA_, and _COGAIN_. In James' diverse projects and interdisciplinary endeavors, a consistent theme prevails: harnessing technology and the power of computational modelling to enhance the lives of people.
