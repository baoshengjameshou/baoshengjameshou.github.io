I'm a PhD student in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), part of the GEMINI project team at Lancaster University, advised byÂ Prof. Hans Gellersen. In GEMINI, we create multimodal interfaces that let users interact more naturally in extended reality (XR), using their eyes and body in concert.

In my research, I apply machine learning (ML) and signal processing to model human behaviour as context for interaction, with a focus on developing novel eye-head-based interaction techniques. I chase a future where ML-enabled computing power augments human abilities, interfacing with us in naturally human ways.
